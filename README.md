- **Semantic Search**: Generate and store text embeddings for efficient retrieval
- **Context-Aware Answers**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate responses
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, DeepSeek, and other LLM APIs
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new document types or LLM providers

### Advanced Functionality
- FAISS-based vector similarity search
- Chunking and embedding optimization for legal texts
- Configurable similarity thresholds

## Tech Stack

- **Core Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Vector Search**: FAISS
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/DeepSeek APIs
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Document Parsing**: PyPDF2, pdfminer
- **Environment Management**: pip/conda
