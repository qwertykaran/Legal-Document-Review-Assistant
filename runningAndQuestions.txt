✅ How to Run


📁 Step 1: Navigate to Project Folder
Open your terminal (PowerShell or CMD) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\Users\karan\OneDrive\Desktop\legalDocsAi\legalai-main"
🧪 Step 2: Activate Your Virtual Environment
If you're using a venv, activate it:

bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt if activated successfully.

📄 Step 3: Start the Backend or Agent Script
To start responding to user queries:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run_agent.py
This script will:

Load your persisted Chroma vectorstore from disk

Use HuggingFace embeddings (since OpenAI API quota is exceeded)

Accept and respond to queries via terminal/CLI

❗ Only Run ingest_legal_docs.py Again If:
You add, delete, or update the .txt legal clause files in the /data folder.

Otherwise, don’t re-run it every time—you’ll just waste processing time.

🧠 Reminder: What Makes It Work
Your embedded legal data is persisted using Chroma DB.

Your run_agent.py script retrieves this vectorstore and uses a local LLM (via Ollama) to answer questions.
